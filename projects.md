### Protein Stability Estimation and Viral Mutation
Viruses constantly undergo random mutations as they replicate. Those with mutations that disrupt protein function will die out while those with mutations that confer selective advantage will remain. I am interested in using computational tools to estimate protein folding and binding stabilities and see if such calculation can predict viral evolution.

## Past Projects

### Genetics of Lipoprotein Lipase Activity
Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is an important enzyme in triglyeride metabolism and is implicated in cardiac diseases and metabolic syndrome. I studied the relationship between lipid traits and LPL activity in Mexican Americans using statistical analyses and various computational tools.
