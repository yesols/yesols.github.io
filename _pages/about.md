I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Idaho Office of Underserved and Rural Medical Research in the School of Health and Medical Professions, University of Idaho. I began my career as a licensed vocational nurse in California, building experience in caring for diverse patient populations in acute and long-term care facilities around Los Angeles. In the meantime, I continued to pursue education and earned degrees in **biochemistry** (BS), **nursing** (MSN), **biomedical science** (MS), and **bioinformatics and computational biology** (PhD).

I have a wide-ranging research interests including **rural health**, **population-level health outcomes**, and **genomics**. I am particularly interested in utilizing **statistical modeling** and **machine learning** methods to study health outcomes from high-dimensional data.
