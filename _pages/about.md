I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Idaho Office of Underserved and Rural Medical Research](https://www.uidaho.edu/health-medical-professions/idaho-underserved-rural-medical) in the **School of Health and Medical Professions**, **University of Idaho**. 

I began my career in healthcare as a licensed vocational nurse in California, caring for diverse patient populations in acute and long-term care facilities around Los Angeles. In the meantime, I continued education and studied **Biochemistry** and **Nursing**. While working at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center as a staff RN, I was introduced to the fascinating world of biomedical research. With a generous scholarship from Cedars, I completed a Masters program in **Biomedical Science**. I was then ready to fully commit to a life of academia and moved to beautiful Moscow, ID, to pursue PhD in **Bioinformatics and Computational Biology** at the University of Idaho. Under the supervision of Dr. Craig Miller, I learned lab work, programming and statistical modeling.

I have a wide-ranging research interests including **rural health**, **population-level health outcomes**, and **genomics**. I am particularly interested in utilizing **statistical modeling** and **machine learning** methods to study health outcomes from high-dimensional data. 

Outside of work and research, I enjoy reading webtoons and sci-fi novels, hiking and camping, and making art with my daughter.
