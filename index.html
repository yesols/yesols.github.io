<h1> Hello! </h1>
<p> My name is Yesol (pronounced like yes-all), 
  a PhD student in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, a registered nurse, and a hobby artist.
<p> My academic interests oscillated between basic science and clinical nursing throughout my life;
  the desire to be a scientist finally won over, 
  and my husband and I moved to beautiful Idaho with our cat to pursue our studies.
<p> I miss the hospital - taking care of patients and nursing staff, and it is strange to be a full-time student again. 
  While it is a drastic life change, I'm having a lot of fun doing biology with computer programming and math.
<p> Check out my pages for more info and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like a chat.
<p> Cheers!
