<h1> Hello! </h1>
<p> My name is Yesol (pronounced like yes-all), 
  a PhD student in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, a registered nurse in oncology, 
  and a hobby artist who loves illustrations in ink.
<p> My academic interests oscillated between basic science and clinical nursing throughout my life;
  the desire to be a scientist finally won over, 
  and my husband and I moved to beautiful Idaho with our cat to pursue our studies.
<p> I enjoy thinking about fundamental biological processes (i.e. how DNA and RNA work, how proteins get made, etc) 
  in the context of biochemical and physical principles.
<p> Check out my pages for more info and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.
<p> Cheers!
